# Project Goal
Create a website that serves as a means of displaying the devs portfolio. This must include:
- inticing home page
- about me page that details both personal and professional history, present, and perceived future
- portfolio page that includes selected coding projects, and selected art projects, to show case skills
- contact page to be able to interact with media links (github, linkedin, etc.), as well as send a direct email. (colud make this as a modal instead of individual page)

# Anticipated struggles
- making email functional has I haven't performed it before
- managing assets and possibly having to recreate them as they might not function/fit as initially perceived (primarily decoration assets).

# First Steps
Organizing and importing all assets that will be used. Current plan includes:
- picture of dev (edited from jpg to png)
- multiple 'decoration' assets (otters to match preferred aestethic)
- colours to be used
- removing vite+react base stylings
- using css family creation to create standards around how colour

# Processes learnt inbetween 1st and 2nd steps
- Krita funcionality
    - Learnt how to get rid of background for the Profile img
    - Learnt how to use vectors in this app specifically to make all 7 otter svgs
        - chose svgs for otter imgs as it resolved the above anticipated struggle of imgs being pixelated on different screen sizes
- Usefullness of using objects to contain large amounts of text with hierarchies which will allow me to later loop over the object to create components, thus making for cleaner code and less retyping of the same web elements

# Second Steps
Begin organizing stylings so that the website is more accessible in future steps
- Finding fonts and adding them to root as variables
- resizing elements on home page to refine visual standards
    - profile img sizing
    - adding in otter imgs
    - changing h1 styling
    - changing p styling
    - changing button styling
- look at possibly placing footer on home page too, and then sorting out visuals
    - add linkedin logo and link
    - add github logo and link
    - add cv logo and temporary link (CV will be redone soon and then replaced)
    - edit copyright styling
