# Project Goal
Create a website that serves as a means of displaying the devs portfolio. This must include:
- inticing home page
- about me page that details both personal and professional history, present, and perceived future
- portfolio page that includes selected coding projects, and selected art projects, to show case skills
- contact page to be able to interact with media links (github, linkedin, etc.), as well as send a direct email. (colud make this as a modal instead of individual page)

# Anticipated struggles
- making email functional has I haven't performed it before
- managing assets and possibly having to recreate them as they might not function/fit as initially perceived (primarily decoration assets).

# First Steps
Organizing and importing all assets that will be used. Current plan includes:
- fonts
- picture of dev (edited from jpg to png)
- multiple 'decoration' assets (otters to match preferred aestethic)
- colours to be used
- removing vite+react base stylings
- using css family creation to create standards around how colour and fonts are used
