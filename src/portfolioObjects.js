        description: 'The goal of this website was to create the front view of an artificial online macaroon store. Within this project I tried to purposefully challenge myself both to create a site that was visually appealing while also having the common functionalities that would be required of site like this. I also tried to push myself by using react states that I did not have much prior experience with, in order to create a site that could keep track of how many items were added to the cart, what flavors these items were, and how much they cost. The final functional challenge was taking all of that information to display it on a modal screen that displayed the title, allowed the quantities to be changed in a different component, as well as having the functionality of purchasing or clearing the cart without having to reload the site. The last part that I did not expect to be so difficult, but I still learnt a lot through the process, was using media queries in order to make the website fully scalable for small phone screens, to the much larger computer screens.',
